# CGPA
<p>I had Created a Dataset based upon my Previous academic performances using Credits and GPA Of Each Semester</p>
<p>To calculate the Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), you typically need the GPA for each semester or academic term. If your dataset includes information for multiple terms or semesters, you can calculate the CGPA by averaging the GPAs across all terms.</p>
 <P><b>Steps That I Used for Calculating My CGPA:</b></P>
<P>1. I Added a new column for 'Term Credits' if not already present, representing the total credits for each term.</P>
<p>2. Calculate the 'Term Grade Points' for each term by multiplying 'GPA' with 'Term Credits'.</p>
<p>3. Sum the 'Term Grade Points' and 'Term Credits' columns for all terms.</p>
<p>Calculate the CGPA using the formula: CGPA = Total Term Grade Points / Total Term Credits.</p>
